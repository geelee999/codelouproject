Code Louisville Project summer of 2017 Wednesday class Instructions
I made my project a e commerce web site with a shopping cart. I used a mobile first approach and used bootstrap as the framework for the site. I included a carousel that feeds from flickr to reduce the need for adding content. In the desk top version you click on the links in the navbar to navigate from page to page. In the mobile version the menu drops down and you tap on the page you would like to visit.I used css in addition to bootstrap to add style and functionality to the web site.

I used JavaScript to add a submission box to sign up for our deals email offer. I also used ajax to add a gallery page and pull content from flickr instead of adding my own content. The gallery page has its own css file to control the position of the   photos. The user clicks on the selection button to choose the photo category they would like to view.

I used PayPal as my shopping cart as this is a front end class PayPal provides the backend functionality. I also like that you can use PayPal without a security certificate. I built 3 product buttons with different prices and descriptions. I could have made the PayPal cart button custom but chose to keep the default for name recognition and the PayPal brand.

I included programing practices that we learned about in our class room work and from the tree house videos.
